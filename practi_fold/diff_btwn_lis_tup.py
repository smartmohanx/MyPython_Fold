list is a collection of homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
To declare a list we use [ ].
In a list each element is separated by comma (,) .
list is mutable, it means we can modify the elements in a list.

example:- list = [1,2,'a',[a1,b1],True,3,'mohan',5.7]

#TUPLE
'''
Tuple is a collection of homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
To declare a Tuple we use ( ).
In a Tuple each element is separated by comma (,).
Tuple is immutable, it means we cannot modify the elements in
a tuple.

example:- tuple = (1,2,'a',[11,22],True,3,'mohan',5.7)

#DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIST AND TUPLE:
'''
list is a mutable and tuple is immutable(can be modified).
lists consume more memory than tuple.
