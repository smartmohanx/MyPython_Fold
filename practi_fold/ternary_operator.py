#ternary operators:
'''
Ternary operators are also known as conditional expressions,
Ternary operators that evaluates a value based on the condition
being true or false. 

It simply allows testing a condition in a single line replacing
the multiline if-else making the code compact.

"python basically first evaluates the condition,
if True - evaluates the first condition,
else evaluates the second condition."

[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]
'''
# a,b = 15,20
# max = a if a>b else b
# print(max)

# from random import random
# x = random()
# print("i am greater than 0" if x>0 else "i am greater than x")
# print(x)

# #nested ternary
# a,b = 15,15
# print("a=b" if a==b else "a>b" if a>b else "a<b")
